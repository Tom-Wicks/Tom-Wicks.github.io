Hi! I am a student and soon-to-be graduate of Computer Science, and a hobbyist game developer.
I released my first proper game in 2020, but I've been working on various projects as far back as 2017, and I've been coding even further still.
<br>Alongside my studies, I've also essentially taught myself pixel art and music composition, as well as developing an eye for small details and a meticulous approach to problem solving.
You can see a selection of my work below.
